	abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles have the potential to assist humans in tasks such as manipulation and transportation for construction and humanitarian missions, beyond simply acquiring data and building maps. In this letter, we address the state estimation, control, and trajectory planning in cooperative transportation of structures, which are either too heavy or too big to be carried by small microvehicles. Speciﬁcally, we consider small quadrotors, each equipped only with a single camera and inertial measurement unit as a sensor. The key contributions are 1) a new approach to coordinated control, which allows independent control of each vehicle while guaranteeing the system’s stability and 2) a new cooperative localization scheme that allows each vehicle to beneﬁt from measurements acquired by other vehicles. The latter relies on the vehicles exploiting the inherent rigid structure information to infer additional constraints between the vehicles’ poses allowing us to formulate the pose estimation problem as an optimization problem on the Lie group SE(3). The proposed approach is validated through experimental results with multiple quadrotors grasping and transporting a rigid structure.},

	abstract = {Payload manipulation with aerial robots has been an active research area for many years. Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system’s nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a signiﬁcant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simpliﬁcations like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman ﬁlter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full threedimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53º from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.},

	abstract = {With use cases that range from external localisation of single robots or robotic swarms to self-localisation in markeraugmented environments and simplifying perception by tagging objects in a robot’s surrounding, ﬁducial markers have a wide ﬁeld of application in the robotic world. We propose a new family of circular markers which allow for both computationally eﬃcient detection, tracking and identiﬁcation and full 6D position estimation. At the core of the proposed approach lies the separation of the detection and identiﬁcation steps, with the former using computationally eﬃcient circular marker detection and the latter utilising an open-ended ‘necklace encoding’, allowing scalability to a large number of individual markers. While the proposed algorithm achieves similar accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods, its experimental evaluation in realistic conditions demonstrates that it can detect markers from larger distances while being up to two orders of magnitude faster than other stateof-the art ﬁducial marker detection methods. In addition, the entire system is available as an open-source package at https://github.com/LCAS/whycon.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the cooperative manipulation of a cable-suspended load with two generic aerial robots without the need of explicit communication. The role of the internal force for the asymptotic stability of the beam position-andattitude equilibria is analyzed in depth. Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a non-zero internal force is chosen, then the asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam attitude can be achieved with a decentralized and communication-less master-slave admittance controller. If, conversely, a zero internal force is chosen, as done in the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication. Furthermore, we formally proof the output-strictly passivity of the system with respect to an energy-like storage function and a certain input-output pair. This proves the stability and the robustness of the method during motion and in non-ideal conditions. The theoretical ﬁndings are validated through extensive simulations.},
