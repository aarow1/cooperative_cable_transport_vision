Todo ================================

[ ] Make PayloadOdom message
[ ] Create payload odom callback in nodelet
[ ] Replace Corrections message (?)
    |-- exists in so3control nodelet, not sure what they do
[ ] Make consistent naming with SO3Control
[ ] Come up with better name than cablevision
[ ] Create launch files
    |-- simulation first
    |-- make payload just a feedforward path to see how control responds
    |-- viz cable directions and desired directions (may not be necessary)
[ ] Change gains to be vectors in ControlCableVision/calculatecontrol function
    # probably don't want to do this. actually all these gains should be scalars
[ ] make simple payload position and orientation publisher
      - use pose stamped for rviz to keep that part easy
      - lissajous (both x and y are sin, a/b = 2)
      - do some random thing for orientation of the payload, but make it simple
        enough to publish angular vel and acc

Done ================================

[x] Make PayloadPositionCommand message
[x] add payload position command callback to nodelet
[x] Move all payload messages to new package
